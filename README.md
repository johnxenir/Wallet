# Wallet
task for Gamanza

Overview:

Here is only the backend part of the application, it is accessed only via REST requests, it has no user interface whatsoever. File index.js contains the main program, while in queries.js are the functions for the database management. For testing I used 'curl' tool, for example with command: 
"curl --data "wallet_id=jaz&playername=ivo&funds=10" http://localhost:3000/players/" 
to add a wallet for a player, while get requests can be tested just using the browser. The data is passed in json format. The API should detect if an exist player id already exists in database and does not create another one with the same id. Also when withdrawing, the API does not allow to withdraw if the requested amount is greater than the total funds for that player.

Database creation script is autogenerated from DBDesigner site where I designed the database with graphical interface. It is very simple, just mandatory tables and columns.
